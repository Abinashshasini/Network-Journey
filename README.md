## 🌌 What Is This?

You type a URL. You press Enter. A webpage appears.

**But what happens in between?**

Network Journey transforms the invisible milliseconds of internet communication into a breathtaking 3D experience. Watch data packets race through fiber optic cables, witness the TCP handshake unfold in real-time, and fly through the digital infrastructure that connects billions of devices.

> _"Finally, networking concepts that don't put you to sleep."_

<br />

## 🚀 The Experience

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%">

### 🎬 Hyperspace Launch

Begin with a cinematic warp animation — 400 procedurally generated stars streaking past as you accelerate into the network.

</td>

### 🤝 TCP Handshake

Experience the legendary 3-way handshake: SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK, visualized as glowing data packets.

</td>
<td width="50%">

### 🔐 SSL/TLS Encryption

See certificates exchange, keys generate, and secure tunnels establish before your eyes.
